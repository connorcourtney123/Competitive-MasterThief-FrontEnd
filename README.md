# Competitive-MasterThief
## OverView
### This app is an addon to my project 1 MasterThief game. It will have user profiles, friends, and score tracking(highscore, win/lose, etc.)

User Stories    ->  When a user plays the game they can sign into their own profile. See their stats, and see the stats of their friends. The user should also be able create a new profile and add friends. When they win, their win count will go up and when they beat their high score, their saved score will be changed to that score.
